## What is it


This application (in French) can encrypt/decrypt/generate keys of Cesar, optimized Cesar, Vigenère, optimized Vigenère and DES algorithm.
It can also try to attack those algorithm (working with Cesar and partially with Vigenère).

It is possible to export in pdf format encrypting/decrypting done in the application (for training purpose).
You can also export/import encrypted/decrypted files and keys for future use or for other usage.
